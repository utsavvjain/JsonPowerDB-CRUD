# What is JsonPowerDB?
JsonPowerDB is a Database Server with Developer friendly REST API services. It's a High Performance, Light Weight, Ajax Enabled, Serverless, Simple to Use, Real-time Database.
Easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server-side programming/scripting or without installing any kind of database.
Whether it's a Dynamic Website or a Mobile App or some Data Analytics Portal, the development is really fun and fast.
This repository contains the implementation of CRUD operations using JsonPowerDB(JPDB).

# About this project
This repository is made to show users how to perform basic CRUD operations on JPDB. For detailed information please refer to the following documentation [JPDB documentation](http://login2explore.com/jpdb/docs.html)
* For a video demo please refer to following link [JPDB-CRUD Demo](https://github.com/utsavvjain/JsonPowerDB-CRUD/raw/main/JPDB-DEMO.mp4)

# Benifits of Using JsonPowerDB
JsonPowerDB (JPDB) is Next Generation, Creative and Disruptive Multi-mode DBMS_ with many USPs.
* Proprietary algorithm for High-Performance CRUD operations. Multiple times faster than popular DBMS.
* Serverless support for faster development - A UI developer can develop a complete dynamic application.
* DBMS with built-in web application and embedded caching makes the performance lightning fast.
* Server-side Native NoSQL - best query performance.
* In-built support to query on multiple JPDB databases.
* Multi-mode DBMS - Document DB, Key-Value DB, RDBMS support.
* Schema-free - easy to develop and maintain.
* Web-services API - This can be used with any programming language that has support for HTTP.
* Enriched by a pluggable API Framework - A developer can develop a pluggable API and plugin into any of JPDB cloud instances.
* Standardization of API development framework makes the development process easy, more readable, and less error-prone.
* Multiple security layers.
